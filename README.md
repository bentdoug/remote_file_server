CS-475 Computer Networks Final Project


README

Note: This README is for our group submission, including Ian Utz, Ben Douglas, and Matthew Parias

1. We implemented a file sharing system as our final project. We encountered some issues,
such as a bad file descriptor after the first command was given to by the client. We
fixed this issue by 

2. The group consisted of Ben Douglas, who was responsible for the controller and command lines,
Matthew Parias, who was responsible for the TFTP protocol, and Ian Utz, who was responsible for
the Database initalization and the connection between the user interface and the controller for the
client

3. All work was done by somebody in the group. There was no outside help, with the exception of
using the libraries that are imported in the respective files.

4. We liked this assignment. It was a challenge but it used all skills that we have
learned throughout the semester to fully implement correctly.

5. This assignment took about 10-12 hours in total to finish over the course of a week

6. Using the grading specifications on the page, we think that this assignment deserves an
A, since we implemented the code in an efficient manner with comments as needed so if
others were to use the code, they would not be lost. Additionally, each python file in
the project has its own responsibility, and we were able to establish those as well as
communicate between files successfully

7. No other concerns from us!
